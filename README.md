This is the repository storing code for our Rock Band playing robot, a submission for Hack ISU Spring of 2016.

It consisted of a Windows Machine running OpenCV with a Microsoft LifeCam focused on the screen, connected via USB to an Arduino that controlled the actuators and servos pushing the buttons on the controller.
